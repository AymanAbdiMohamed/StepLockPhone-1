# StepLockPhone-1

StepLockPhone is a React Native app built with Expo (Dev Client / Bare workflow) that locks your phone in the morning and allows it to be unlocked only after reaching a certain number of steps. The app uses the device's step counter to track activity and enforces a lock screen until the step goal is met.


## Features

- Morning lock trigger
- Step counter tracking via `expo-sensors`
- Full-screen lock UI until required steps are reached
- Unlock automatically when step goal is completed
- Native module integration for Android locking
